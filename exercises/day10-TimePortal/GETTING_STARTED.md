# Day 10: Opening the Time Portal 🌀

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Choose your language

#### Java

```bash
cd java
./mvnw test
```

#### C#

```bash
cd csharp
dotnet test
```

#### Kotlin

```bash
cd kotlin
./gradlew test
```

#### Scala

```bash
cd scala
sbt test
```

#### TypeScript

```bash
cd typescript
npm install
npm test
```

You should see:
- **CHRONOS tests (ArchUnit)**: Multiple failures — these are the Object Calisthenics rules to fix
- **Behavior tests**: All passing — these ensure you don't break functionality while refactoring

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] All ArchUnit/CHRONOS tests pass (Object Calisthenics rules satisfied)
- [ ] All behavior tests still pass (no regressions)
- [ ] Code compiles
- [ ] At least 4 Object Calisthenics rules addressed

*Good luck, Traveler. The safety of the Universe depends on you.*
