On the second day of the journey, we are recalling [this memory from the first week of 2024](https://github.com/advent-of-craft/2024/blob/main/docs/day02/challenge.md), but the memory sounds ancient, a game, it seems, the first men where playing.

Yes, we are talking about FizzBuzz. The infamous game.
This time, we are trying to extend the game and externalize the rules...

But we can't do it the usual way.

## Challenge — Change your stack and IDE.

Today, you will choose another stack and IDE. 
The list of stack is C#, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, Scala, PHP and Python.

For IDEs, you can try the mainstream Jetbrains ones, Visual Code or other stack related ones.

You can also try the lightweight IDE such as ZED or Antigravity with the help of the AI.

## Where to play

Pick the stack you want to use as your **main stack** this year and open the Day 2 memory.

- `memories/2023/exercises/<your-stack>/day01`

Let the game flow ➰💫
