# Day 03 – SOLID from another angle

On the third day of the journey, we’re revisiting a memory from 2024 where a simple question kept coming back:  

 > **Did I need to do all of this?**

Today’s goal is to *experience* SOLID in two modes on a small piece of code:

1. **“By the book” SOLID** – push it a bit further than usual.  
2. **“Sensible” SOLID** – keep only what actually helps.

You will add your experience in your commits for all these phases.

## Challenge — Try SOLID literally, then make peace with it

The point of today is to over-engineer the design by blindly following SOLID to the letter. Pick a small hotspot in your code.

Then pause, write down your observation, complexity metrics, pain points, etc.

Then, 'think' SOLID and go for a more pragmatic design.

The end result does **not** need to be perfectly SOLID.  
It just needs to be **clearer and more intentional** than what you started with.

If you still have the complexity tool from Day 1, you can optionally compare the original and your final version to see whether complexity went up, down, or just moved.

Share your code and observations along the way.


## Where to play

Pick the stack you want to use as your **main stack** this year and open the Day 12 memory from 2024. For an easier day, pick the day 12 of 2023:

- `memories/2024/exercises/<your-stack>/day12`

| Mode              | Memory                                         | Suggested for…                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 🧭 **Standard**   | `memories/2024/exercises/<your-stack>/day12`  | More than one reason to refactor |
| 🟢 **Easy**  | `memories/2023/exercises/<your-stack>/day12`  | A simple OCP centric exercise  |

Let the design breathe ➰💫

and open a pull request.

Use the `journey/your-name.md` file and write an entry for today:

- What changed when I applied SOLID “by the book”?  
- Where did it clearly improve the code?  
- Where did it make things heavier, and what did I simplify in the final commit?  
- Did modelling behaviour helped me better?
