# Day 9 - A conventional journey.

On the ninth day of the journey, we revisit a **memory from 2024** where we were asked to map our progress with the Mikado method:

Today, the memory has been modified. The approach AND the code is different. 

You are asked to make a list of 4 to 6 changes that will be reflect in your commits.

This is the last day of the consolidation phase!  Tomorrow, we enter the fabric of time. ➿

## Challenge — Refactor the code using conventional commits.

For today's exercise, here are the basic steps:
 1) Write down a list of things to refactor.
 2) Plan your refactoring (what to do first).
 3) Get familiar with conventional commits ([Conventional Commits Guide](conventional_commits_guide.md)).
 4) Execute the refactoring.
 5) Generate a change note (Claude, where are you?) or just a git history.
 6) Share every steps on Discord and in your journey book.

## Where to play

Pick the stack you want to use as your **main stack** this year and open the Day 10 memory from 2024:

- `memories/2024/exercises/<your-stack>/day13`

This is your playground.

## Share with the community

On Discord, you can share:

 - your refactoring plan, 
 - your solution, 
 - your commit history as a beautiful change notes.

If you want your work to be public, add your file to:

- `community/solutions/dayNN/` by copying the template:  
  `community/solutions/TEMPLATE-[replace_with_your_name].md`  
- then open a pull request.

In `journey/your-name.md`, write a short entry for today:

 - How would reviewing 6 small conventional commits compare to reviewing 1 large "refactored everything" commit?
 - If a test broke after your refactoring, how would conventional commits help you identify which change caused it?
 - Did the conventional commit format make you think differently about how you grouped changes?

**Let's have fun conventionally! ☑️**
