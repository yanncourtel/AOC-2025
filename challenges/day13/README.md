  ==> **Loading Fractured Memory** <==

On the 13th day, the fractured memory sends you to finish the work of the elf who's fixing the trip service of Santa.

A trivial refactoring. The issue is...

You are part of the team led by Theoficlus, technical director of the IT team in Xmas Town in this timeline. 

He has implemented a policy of using **ONLY the keyboard** to code as it is "more productive" he says.

Any mouse click results in a decrease in our monthly paycheck...

## Challenge — Use only you mouse in your IDE.

Today is likely to be the most challenging day of the adventure. Not because the code is complicated but because the constraints might be impossible to overcome.

1) The initial constraint: The main method getTripsByUser needs to be covered by tests at 100% before refactoring.

2) Try to use the keyboard only in the whole exercise.

Some help:

- Use AI on chat mode on the side to help you find the right shortcut for your IDE. (oustide of the IDE, mouse is allowed)
- record the number of clicks you were forced to do and let's see if someone was able to do it using 0 clicks!

## Where to play

For the exploration of the fractured memories, since they are not your own memories
We will go to /exercises and the dayNN

You can then pick the stack you want to use as your **main stack**.

- `exercises/day13/<your-stack>/`

This is your playground.

## Share with the community

On Discord, you can share:

 - How many clicks you recorded and if you were able to do it without any.
 - Which strategy did you use? Neovim? VsCode with an AI chat? Vibe coding?

If you want your work to be public, add your file to:

- `community/solutions/dayNN/` by copying the template:  
  `community/solutions/TEMPLATE-[replace_with_your_name].md`  
- then open a pull request.

In `journey/your-name.md`, write a short entry for today:

 - How the constraint help me know my IDE?
 - Which shortcut I am going to remember?
 - Have I actually been more productive?

**Let's show these elves we can use our keyboard! ⌨️**
