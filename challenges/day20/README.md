  ==> **Loading Fractured Memory** <==

On the 20th day, the memory is throwing you into a heated meeting between elves and Santa.

They don't agree on how they should handle their new building infrastructure...
The idea is to power the new building with magical power instead of electricity.

But the equipment used is from the Sleigh system using Reindeer to passively power it.

It seems the architecture target of Santa isn't making everyone happy.

**You have to help them**

## Challenge — Propose an architecture to handle this new feature.

Today the exercise is not a code one. Not strictly speaking.
You are to analyze the code base that you probably know, the sleigh system.

The technical experts are clear on how reindeer would need to power it.

### Technical report from the manufacturers
 - 20 magical units per minute would be sufficient to power a big building.
 - Each reindeer would need to rest at least 10 minutes between shift to replenish their power.

You need to come up with a new architecture to handle both the sleigh AND the building.

You can come up with a mermaid graph to explain your changes.

## Where to play

For the exploration of the fractured memories, since they are not your own memories
We will go to /exercises and the dayNN

You can then pick the stack you want to use as your **main stack**.

- `exercises/day20/<your-stack>/`

This is your playground.

## Share with the community

On Discord, you can share:

 - Which tool did you use to present a current architecture?
 - How did you approach the new functionality?

If you want your work to be public, add your file to:

- `community/solutions/dayNN/` by copying the template:  
  `community/solutions/TEMPLATE-[replace_with_your_name].md`  
- then open a pull request.

In `journey/your-name.md`, write a short entry for today:

 - What is your target architecture?
 - What would you first refactor?

**Let's renew Xmas infrastructure. 🏢**
