# Day 23 - Stabilizing The Karma ⚡

> _December 23, 2025 - Stabilizing the Karma system_

![snippet of the day](img/day23.png)

On the 23rd day, we are tackling the most critical system in which the Universe can expand.
**The time portal that produces the Karma**

The system consumes timelines and allows the Universe to expand.

It is currently leaking and it's our job to find out where the leak is.

## Challenge — Improve the Karma System's performances.

Today the exercise is about refactoring towards performance.

**you have to keep the test running while improving the overall performance**

You can install your favorite framework or tool to add performance tests.

## Where to play

For the last part of the adventure, the final activations,
We will go to /exercises and the dayNN

You can then pick the stack you want to use as your **main stack**.

- `exercises/day23/<your-stack>/`

This is your playground.

In `journey/your-name.md`, write a short entry for today:

 - What advantage the stack you chose had?

**Let's leave the karma better than how we found it. ➰☑️**
