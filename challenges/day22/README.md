# Day 22 - Fixing the timeloop processor ➰🕓

> _December 22, 2025 - Fixing the timeloop processor_

![snippet of the day](img/day22.png)

On the 22nd day, we are entering the last phase of the adventure when we are fixing time itself.

The first system that has an issue is the timeloop processor. 
It is broken. Events are getting lost in temporal paradoxes.

You task is to fix the bug AND to move the system in a stack not supported in the exercise.

## Challenge — Fix and migrate the failing system.

Today, you need to fix the way the timeloop are being processed.
The solution isn't to avoid parallelism - we NEED to process multiple realities simultaneously for performance. 

**This is software modernization:** Moving from languages that allow temporal paradoxes to languages that prevent them by design.

The unsupported language you can migrate it to: 
 - Kotlin
 - Rust
 - F#.

## Where to play

For the last part of the adventure, the final activations,
We will go to /exercises and the dayNN

You can then pick the stack you want to use as your **main stack**.

- `exercises/day22/<your-stack>/`

This is your playground.

## Share with the community

On Discord, you can share:

 - Which stack you use and why?

If you want your work to be public, add your file to:

- `community/solutions/dayNN/` by copying the template:  
  `community/solutions/TEMPLATE-[replace_with_your_name].md`  
- then open a pull request.

In `journey/your-name.md`, write a short entry for today:

 - What advantage the stack you chose had?
 - Why parallelism and asynchronism need to be used carefully?

**Let's modernize the timeloop processor. ➰🕓**
