On the 25th day, we can rest knowing we saved the Universe and we can come back to learn.

As if we were just writing our first line of code.

**Please, share what you documented during the adventure.**

## Challenge — Generate an html visual of your journey.

Today is about having fun. You can generate a html from your md with your botmoji for instance to show what you've learned this year.

Each participants will generate a nice html visual of their journey for the AOC 2025.

## Where to play

For the journey day, you can push your html visual for the exercise.

You can then add a folder with **your name** and inside .

- `exercises/day25/<your-name>/`

This is your playground.

**Your journey will be put on display in the advent of craft website**
