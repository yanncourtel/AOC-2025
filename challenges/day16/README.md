  ==> **Loading Fractured Memory** <==

On the 15th day, your fractured memory takes you to a world in which exceptions are ruining systems.
They are everywhere and they are plunging the world in chaos... and you have to fix Santa's Xmas list! 

Your job is to switch to a different approach, handle edge cases for differently.

**After all, isn't exceptions to handle exceptional scenarios?**

A shift in paradigm might help.

## Challenge — Don't use exceptions to handle failures.

Today is not trivial. We are questioning our use of exceptions. 
In this code base, the exception are especially wrongly used.

You are to use the skills you know since the beginning of the adventure to handle failures.

 1) A result object.
 2) A monadic structure.

Use the approach that you want but you will need to shift your perception.

**Hint:** Start with one builder. Let the pattern emerge. Don't build everything upfront.

## Where to play

For the exploration of the fractured memories, since they are not your own memories
We will go to /exercises and the dayNN

You can then pick the stack you want to use as your **main stack**.

- `exercises/day15/<your-stack>/`

This is your playground.

## Share with the community

On Discord, you can share:

 - What approach did you end up taking?
 - Did you switch your approach midway through your refactoring?

If you want your work to be public, add your file to:

- `community/solutions/dayNN/` by copying the template:  
  `community/solutions/TEMPLATE-[replace_with_your_name].md`  
- then open a pull request.

In `journey/your-name.md`, write a short entry for today:

 - What do you think of functional programming techniques?
 - How do you use exceptions in your daily code?

**Let's move past exceptions! ❌**
