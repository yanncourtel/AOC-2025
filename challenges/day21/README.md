  ==> **Loading All Memories** <==

On this 21st day, we finished collecting the memories but one final step is required before we can work on the time portal.

**We need to send our contribution to the craft to keep the portal active.**

The way we will do it today is by illustrating a small concept in a visual way, by a code snippet before/after or through a simple diagram.

## Challenge — Push your own concept.

Today the exercise is about you.

You are to illustrate a simple craft concept you hold dear.

Some ideas:
 - A before / after code snippets with an explanation
 - A graph with a methodology.
 - A code exercise.
 - A slideshow with a code resolution.
 - etc

---

## Where to play

For the contribution day, you can push your visual, graph or readme file in the folder for the exercise.

You can then add a folder with **your name** and inside .

- `exercises/day21/<your-name>/`

This is your playground.

## Share with the community

On Discord, you can share:

 - Which concept did you choose and why?

If you want your work to be public, add your file to:

- `community/solutions/dayNN/` by copying the template:  
  `community/solutions/TEMPLATE-[replace_with_your_name].md`  
- then open a pull request.

In `journey/your-name.md`, write a short entry for today:

 - When was the last time you shared a concept with your team?
 - How I can do that in my everyday life?

**Let's be creative and have fun! 👨‍💻👩‍💻**
